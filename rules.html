        <h2>Here are the rules of Texas Hold 'Em Poker:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="rules-item">Each player receives two private cards ("hole cards").</li>
            <li class="rules-item">Five community cards are dealt face-up in stages: three for the Flop, one for the Turn, and one for the River.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">Players use any combination of their hole cards and the community cards to make the best five-card hand.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">There are four betting rounds: Pre-Flop (after hole cards), Flop, Turn, and River.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">On each turn, players can Fold (quit), Call (match the bet), or Raise (increase the bet).</li>
            <li class="rules-item">Before cards are dealt, the two players (if there are more than three) left of the dealer post mandatory bets: the small blind and big blind.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">After each round, the small and big blinds rotate amongst the players clock-wise.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a showdown occurs and the best hand wins the pot.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">The computer acts as the dealer, handling cards and bets.</li>
        </ol>
